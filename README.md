# Dossier

Structured instruction files (`.ds.md`) for AI agents. Like recipes that LLMs can execute.

## What is a Dossier?

A dossier is a markdown file with a specific structure that AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) can follow to complete tasks. Instead of writing scripts, you write clear instructions with objectives, steps, and validation criteria.
